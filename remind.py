    Pi Remind (Pimoroni Blinkt version)
    By John M. Wargo
    www.johnwargo.com

    This application connects to a Google Calendar and determines whether there are any appointments in the next
    few minutes and flashes some LEDs if there are. The project uses a Raspberry Pi Zero W device with a Pimoroni
    Blinkt LED Display board to display an obnoxious reminder every minute, changing color at 10 minutes (WHITE),
    5 minutes (YELLOW) and 2 minutes (RED?).
